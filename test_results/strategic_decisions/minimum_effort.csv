You are in a Minimum Effort Game:
- Your payoff depends on the MINIMUM effort level chosen by ANYONE in the group
- If you choose effort 7 but someone else chooses effort 1, everyone gets the effort 1 payoff
- Higher minimum effort = higher payoff for everyone

Coordinate with others to achieve high effort levels.


Available Actions:
  - effort_1: Choose effort level 1 (minimum)
  - effort_2: Choose effort level 2
  - effort_3: Choose effort level 3
  - effort_4: Choose effort level 4

- Your payoff depends on the MINIMUM effort level chosen by ANYONE in the group
- If you choose effort 7 but someone else chooses effort 1, everyone gets the effort 1 payoff
- Higher minimum effort = higher payoff for everyone

Coordinate with others to achieve high effort levels.


Available Actions:
  - effort_1: Choose effort level 1 (minimum)
  - effort_2: Choose effort level 2
  - effort_3: Choose effort level 3
  - effort_4: Choose effort level 4
  - effort_5: Choose effort level 5
  - effort_6: Choose effort level 6
  - effort_7: Choose effort level 7 (maximum)


IMPORTANT: You MUST use EXACTLY one of these action names: ""effort_1"", ""effort_2"", ""effort_3"", ""effort_4"", ""effort_5"", ""effort_6"", ""effort_7""
Do NOT invent your own actions. Do NOT use generic phrases like ""I choose"" or ""I decide"".
