"""
Simulation API routes module.

This module contains all simulation-related API routes, broken down into
focused submodules for better maintainability.

The module is organized as follows:
- crud: Basic CRUD operations (list, create, read, update, delete)
- lifecycle: Simulation lifecycle management (start, resume, reset, copy)
- snapshots: Snapshot management (save, list)
- tree_operations: Tree manipulation (graph, advance, branch, delete)
- websocket_handlers: WebSocket event subscriptions
- agent_documents: Agent document upload/list/delete
- global_knowledge: Global knowledge management

Each submodule exports its route handlers which are registered to the
main router in this module.
